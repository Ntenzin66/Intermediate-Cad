# Intermediate-Cad


## Skateboard

## Description

The somewhat assembled skateboard with the parts. The goals of the addignment were tocreat individual parts of a skateboard and then at the end assemble them together to make a full skateboard with the deck, trucks, and wheels. I started with the deck, then the trucks, and then finally the wheels. The parts themselves are pretty simple to follow as they have step-by-step directions on how to make them. It was very simple and easy to follow and I learned many thinbgs from it.

## Reflection 

I learned how to use the use function on my shapes that I extrude, learned how to make variables and modify them to my own needs, learned more about the revolve function, and learned many useful shortcuts that can limit the amount of time spent looking for specific tools.
