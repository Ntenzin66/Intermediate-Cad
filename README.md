# Intermediate-Cad


## Description

The goal of the assignment was to create a skateboard from a variety of parts and use a variety of shortcuts to my advantage. As I followed the steps for each individual part of the skateboard, I learned many new techniques and shortcuts. These shortcuts and techniques will be very useful in my future for my productivity.

You can use Shift+S as a shortcut to create a new sketch on any of the planes you desire. You can also use Shift+E and select any sketch and it will extrude it for you.
