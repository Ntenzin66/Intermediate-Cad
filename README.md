# Intermediate-Cad


## Description

The goal of the assignment was to create a skateboard from a variety of parts and use a variety of shortcuts to my advantage. As I followed the steps for each individual part of the skateboard, I learned many new techniques and shortcuts. These shortcuts and techniques will be very useful in my future for my productivity.

## 2.1 Designing The Deck

I used Shift+S as a shortcut to create a new sketch on any of the planes I wanted to make a sketch on. I also used Shift+E on any selected sketch and it would extrude it. These shortcuts helped with me with the rest of the steps. 

## 2.2 Designing The Trucks

In this section I make use of the offset tool, which shortcut is O. It can be used to modify an already drawn sketch inwards or outwards. The Use tool, which shortcut is U, is also useful and it let me project edges of a part onto the current sketch plane, but you do need to choose the right plane otherwise it will not work. 

## 2.3 Wheels And Bearings

In order to get the spherical shape of the wheel, I used the revolve tool on my sketch, the shortcut for the revolve tool is R. It can be used on one sketch or multiple sketches. 

## 2.4 Putting It All Together

For the assembly, I used many helpful tools. The main tool being the replicate tool. The replicate tools lets me, as the name says, replicate screws or bolts on certain parts or faces to fit any other holes that I need to fit the screws or bolts into. This tool is very helpful as it saves time and is pretty simple to use.
